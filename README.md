## Develop new parsers
Since release `12.0.0` novel manager is totally free.
Developer could now create parsers package and use it in novelmanager instead of the current app parser.
To do this please follow this guide [here](https://github.com/AlenToma/NovelManager-public/blob/master/createNewPackage.md)

## Settings upp your own local database api
Start by downloading `NovelManager.Sqllite.api` and then simple open powershell cd to `NovelManager.Sqllite.api` and run `npm install` and then run
`node dist/Server.js path='E:\\Database\\NovelManager\\' port=51189`

In the app you input your own local/public ip in the `API settings` sections and then restart the app.

Note: to use public Ip do not forget to port forword your ip in the router.

## Buy the source code
As you see the application only display what the plugins sends. For those who want to buy the source code for the app, then leave a message and we could talk about it. 

Note: I will be selling the source code and also help understanding the code, you will not own the rights for the app meanings I could also sell it to others. 

The app is build with React-native and expo, I have only build an android version and have not tried ios as I do not own mac, but you should not have any issue with building an ios version  as I do not have any native code and only js.
